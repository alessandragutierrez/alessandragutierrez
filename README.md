### About Me

It's truly an amazing feeling when I participate in a craft that allows space for both the left and right side of my brain to work together 🧠 -- where creativity, imagination, structure, and order can all intertwine together, creating a harmonious equilibrium ☯️. So, it was no surprise why I quickly fell in love with coding 💻.  Moreover, I also enjoy photography 📷, making music 🎶, and reading 📚.

Every day is a good day to learn something new. 💭💡😎
